# Simple-RESTful-API
RESTful API for Basic Book Management with Flask and SQLAlchemy

This Python script utilizes the Flask web framework along with Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy extensions to create a RESTful API for managing a collection of books. 
It defines a BookModel class representing the book model with attributes like name, author, and year of publication. 
The API supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for individual books identified by their unique IDs. It includes endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting books. The SQLite database, database.db, is used to store book information
